GNOME.Asia summit 2014 will be held in Beijing,China. The first ever GNOME.Asia Summit 2008 was hosted in Beijing. It will be great for GNOME.Asia to come back to Beijing again in the coming year. Beijing, the capital of the People’s Republic of China, has been the political and cultural center of China for centuries. The city is renowned for its palaces, temples, huge stone walls and gates, and its art treasures and universities have made it a center of culture and art in China. There are good airport connections, and train/bus/subway infrastructure. We believe that hosting the event in Beijing will bring the spotlight on GNOME and make an impact locally, regionally and internationally in terms of business and community building.

GNOME.Asia Summit 2014 will provide a unique opportunity for stakeholders to discuss Free and Open Source Software solutions, programming, promotion and community growth challenges for the GNOME project and in Asia. Besides being a community event, the summit is set up to function as a gateway for companies interested in Asian markets. 

We are offering sponsorship partnership for the event.

As a sponsor, you are offered:
* Matchmaking opportunities for companies with local enterprises, been invited to business session;
* Marketing opportunities to be featured in conference materials and presented in media announcements;
* Networking with highly capable developers and well-trained students.

We are expecting about 300 participants with delegates from Asia and around the world. The GNOME.Asia Summit is a unique and international conference which offers sponsors the chance to tap into fast-growing local markets, discover new business opportunities and increase awareness for their products among early adopters and technology multipliers.

History of GNOME Asia
===

This will be the sixth edition of the GNOME.Asia Summit. In previous years GNOME.Asia Summit has been held in Beijing, China in 2008 and Ho-Chi-Minh City, Vietnam in 2009, co-hosted with COSCUP Taipei, Taiwan in 2010, Bangalore, India in 2011, Hong Kong in 2012 and Seoul, Korea in 2013, following the release of GNOME 3.8. 

GNOME.Asia Summit 2013 in Seoul, Korea attracted hundreds of participants including many GNOME developers, speakers andcommunity members within Korea. Karen Sandler, Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation and Allan Day delivered keynotes and there was a 2-track programme with 3 workshops. 

In 2012 in Hong Kong, 26 foreign speakers and 4 local speakers shared their experiences in various aspects around GNOME. Participants from other Asian countries including Mainland China and Taiwan got together face-to-face with Hong Kong activists to build stronger relationships.

GNOME.Asia Summit 2011 was held in India just before the launch of GNOME 3.0. There were 40 presentations and lightning talks from 30 speakers coming as far as Canada, USA, France, Germany, Belgium, and Sweden. Of course Asian countries such as China, Taiwan, the Philippines and India were well represented too. About a thousand participants attended the event with 15 sponsors and partners.

GNOME.Asia Summit 2010, co-organized with COSCUP, was a full two-day conference with over 60 presentations and speakers coming from places all over the world such as China, Philippines, Japan, India, USA, France, Spain, Germany and of course Taiwan. The BOFs and lightning talks helped to bring the conference to a new level. A total of 977 participants, 25 sponsors, 20 news outlets, and 10 exhibitors (including communities) supported the event.

GNOME.Asia Summit 2009 in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) attracted 1465 developers, students, business professionals and government officials establishing Vietnam as one of the top spots for the Free and Open Source community and businesses. In total 14 countries, 79 speakers with 34 from outside of Vietnam, and 109 presentations were held.

The GNOME.Asia Summit 2014 will be held in China. Beijing is a convenient and exciting place to hold the conference. With great public transportation and solid international flight connections, it will be easy for attendees to travel to the event. Beijing also has great tourist attractions, many universities with strong student communities, and is home to many of Chinese largest technology companies. Interest in Free and Open Source Software is growing more than ever in China. The organizing team believes that hosting the event in Beijing will expand GNOME's presence and increase participation in the area.

The Sponsorship Process
===

The following is the flow of action as far as sponsorships are concerned:
 1. Prospective Sponsor (You) receives the Sponsor Document (this document that you are reading)
 2. Decision is made to become a sponsor of GNOME.Asia 2014, and the sponsorship level
 3. An e-mail is sent to committee@gnome.asia, informing the organizers of your decision
 4. GNOME.Asia will confirm that the sponsor slot is still available, and will send you an invoice and a contract, along with detailed payment instructions.
 5. You sign the contract, and return it to GNOME.Asia
 6. You initiate internal approvals for the payment of the invoice, and release the payment of the invoice to GNOME.Asia.
 7. GNOME.Asia sends you the sponsorship acceptance letter.

Please note that all sponsorships are first come, first serve, and that no sponsorship is considered final until step 6 is completed.

To ensure that matters move quickly and smoothly, we use electronic documents and transactions where possible. Therefore, the invoice and contract will be sent to you as a printable PDF file. This has been found to be acceptable by most people over the past few years.

If, however, you require paper documents to start processing matters, we can courier them to your nearest office. However, please be aware that this could slow down the process, and that other potential sponsors could move faster to secure the sponsorship slot.
Once the sponsorship has been secured, you will receive instructions about logo formats, banners, marketing collateral, etc. Each item will have dates associated with it. Please ensure that the requested material reaches us by the deadline – if you miss the deadline, that particular item may not be processed.

For example – if we indicate that logos are required by a certain date so that we can include them in the advertisements (if you are at a sponsorship level where your logo would be included in an advertisement) and you miss that deadline, the advertisement may be published without your logo.

If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact us at committee@gnome.asia
