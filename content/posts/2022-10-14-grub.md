### Descriptions
* grub-common

```bash
/etc/grub.d/*
/usr/bin/grub-mkimage
/usr/sbin/grub-probe
```

 This package contains common files shared by the distinct flavours of GRUB.
 It is shared between GRUB Legacy and GRUB 2, although a number of files
 specific to GRUB 2 are here as long as they do not break GRUB Legacy.

* grub2-common -> grub-common (-> means depend)

```bash
/usr/sbin/grub-install
/usr/sbin/grub-reboot
/usr/sbin/grub-set-default
/usr/sbin/update-grub
```

 This package contains common files shared by the distinct flavours of GRUB.
 The files in this package are specific to GRUB 2, and would break GRUB
 Legacy if installed on the same system.

* grub-pc-bin -> grub-common

```bash
/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/*.mod
```

 This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use with the
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It can be installed in parallel with
 other flavours, but will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot
 loader nor automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-pc is also
 installed.

* grub-efi-amd64 -> grub-efi-amd64-bin, grub2-common

```bash
/usr/share/bug/grub-efi-amd64/presubj
/usr/share/bug/grub-efi-amd64/script
```

 This is a dependency package for a version of GRUB that has been built for
 use with the EFI-AMD64 architecture, as used by Intel Macs (unless a BIOS
 interface has been activated).  Installing this package indicates that this
 version of GRUB should be the active boot loader

* grub-efi-amd64-bin -> grub-common, grub-efi-amd64-signed

```bash
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/*.mod
```

 This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use with the
 EFI-AMD64 architecture, as used by Intel Macs (unless a BIOS interface has
 been activated).  It can be installed in parallel with other flavours, but
 will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot loader nor
 automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-efi-amd64 is also
 installed.

* grub-efi-amd64-signed -> grub-efi-amd64-bin, grub-efi-amd64, grub2-common

```bash
/usr/lib/grub
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed/gcdx64.efi.signed
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed/grubnetx64.efi.signed
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed/grubx64.efi.signed
/usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi-signed/version
```

 This package contains a version of GRUB built for use with the EFI-AMD64
 architecture, signed with Canonical's UEFI signing key.
